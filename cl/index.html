		<h1>Hello, <span class="awesome">Crush + Lovely</span>. <span>I&#8217;m Jacob Fentress.</span></h1>

		<p>I&#8217;m a front-end web developer in Nashville, Tennessee. I have a passion for well-crafted interfaces&#8212;design and code. My desire is to work on things that make a difference in people&#8217;s lives; things that help them learn, help them grow, help them improve their lives&#8212;work and play&#8212;in meaningful ways. Frankly, I care. I care about my code and about the value of the things I code. I want to work with folks who also care about these things, and I would love to work with you.</p>

		<p>But maybe I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let me tell you a bit about my background.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been accidentally building websites for a decade. Accidentally, because this was nowhere on my radar in school. After graduating from Belmont University in 2003 (summa cum laude) I started producing a talk-radio show. On my first day, they asked if I&#8217;d ever worked on websites because they had a page they needed me to keep updated. I started reading up on how to do this stuff and just couldn&#8217;t stop. Soon, my full-time job was running and building websites. I spent five years at a small non-profit, where I was <em>the web guy</em>, and have worked another five years at LifeWay, where I am currently supervising a team of nine who handle all of our web design and front-end development.</p>

		<h2>Things you might like to know about&nbsp;me</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>I&#8217;ve been married nine years and have two wonderful kids. Family is very important, which is good because we have quite a bit of it around here. This makes working remotely a very appealing choice. I&#8217;d like to stay near my family, but still work with some top-notch people in the industry.</li>
			<li>I like to work in my garden and build things with my hands. My last major project was a 14-foot bookshelf behind a spiral staircase. Next up, a bench for my kitchen.</li>
			<li>I have a background in theatrical design and production&#8212;lights, sets, audio. This is where I think I really learned the values of craft, creative problem solving, and melding the technical with the artistic.</li>
			<li>Teaching other people HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a passion. I lead weekly &#8220;intermediate to advanced&#8221; classes with my team, and I love seeing that information passed on and then used to make awesome things. I am also starting a &#8220;beginners&#8221; class that other people at my company can participate in. I developed a curriculum for this sort of training about a year ago, which is continuously refined and improved.</li>
			<li>Currently, I&#8217;m doing side projects and freelance as <a href="http://guerillalabs.co">Guerilla Labs</a>. You should take a look at <a href="https://github.com/guerillalabs">our github page</a> to get a sense of some things we&#8217;re working on. You&#8217;ll find several older jQuery plugins, but I want to specifically point out <a href="https://github.com/guerillalabs/air-drop--Jekyll">Air-Drop</a>&#8212;a SASS-based framework and project template. There is a lot in Air-Drop borrowed from other places and a lot we wrote specifically to fit our needs. It is shaping up to be a really helpful tool. Also, the <a href="http://guerillalabs.co">Guerilla Labs</a> site is built in Jekyll.</li>
			<li>SASS has been a big interest lately. I love how it can make writing CSS more efficient and consistent across a project. There are two mixins that I&#8217;m particularly proud of lately. One <a href="https://github.com/guerillalabs/air-drop--Jekyll/blob/master/sass/libs/addons/_media-query.scss">helps with backward-compatibility with media queries</a>. It writes the CSS that IE8 and below need without requiring the developer to write any additional code. The other mixin <a href="https://github.com/guerillalabs/air-drop--Jekyll/blob/master/sass/libs/addons/_grid.scss">generates CSS for a custom grid</a>, which is identical to the CSS that the Gridset app generates (this mixin was created with the blessing of the Gridset team). It is probably the most complex thing I&#8217;ve done in SASS.</li>
			<li>I love that our industry is built on sharing ideas and techniques. While I worry that the barrier to entry is much higher than it was when I started on the web, I&#8217;m so glad that new people can enter, get guidance from seasoned veterans, and start creating amazing things. I recently started using <a href="http://codepen.io/jacobfentress">CodePen</a> as a laboratory to try out and share new code. It also houses a lot of the examples used in the classes I teach.</li>
			<li>Through Guerilla Labs, I send out a fluid email newsletter that links to a lot of web geekery. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://guerillalabs.co/propaganda/">Propaganda</a>.</li>
			<li>Part of my team at LifeWay is working on a responsive rebuild of LifeWay.com. It&#8217;s a fairly large ecommerce site, and I feel that we are doing some very good, trail-blazing work (there aren&#8217;t a lot of responsive ecommerce sites out there). With this build, we&#8217;re taking a modular approach with our components and have been heavily influenced by Jonathan Snook&#8217;s SMACSS.</li>
			<li>There are a lot of other, older projects that I would rather talk through in person&#8212;some are offline, some changed drastically from what I handed off and some I am ashamed of. They include things like implementing a CMS and training our writers to use Markdown as their editing environment&#8212;in early 2006.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Some things I&#8217;m spending more time on right&nbsp;now</h2>

		<ul class="condensed">
			<li>ARIA Roles</li>
			<li>optimization of JavaScript for touch devices</li>
			<li>new CSS layout modules: flexbox, grid</li>
			<li>SVGs</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Let&#8217;s work together</h2>

		<p>I think we could do some great work together. Send me a message through <a href="mailto:jfentress@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jfentress">Twitter</a>, and we&#8217;ll chat.</p>

		<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
