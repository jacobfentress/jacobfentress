		<h1>Hello, <span class="awesome">Cameron</span>. <span>I&#8217;m Jacob Fentress.</span></h1>

		<p>I&#8217;m a front-end web developer in Nashville, Tennessee. I have a passion for well-crafted interfaces&#8212;design and code. My desire is to work on things that make a difference in people&#8217;s lives; things that help them learn, help them grow, help them improve their lives&#8212;work and play&#8212;in meaningful ways. Frankly, I care. I care about my code and about the value of the things I code. I want to work with folks who also care about these things, and I would love to work with you.</p>

		<p>But maybe I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let me tell you a bit about my background.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been accidentally building websites for over a decade. Accidentally, because this was nowhere on my radar in school. After graduating from Belmont University in 2003 (summa cum laude) I started producing a talk-radio show. On my first day, they asked if I&#8217;d ever worked on websites because they had a page they needed me to keep updated. I started reading up on how to do this stuff and just couldn&#8217;t stop. Soon, my full-time job was running and building websites. I spent five years at a small non-profit, where I was <em>the web guy</em>, and worked another five years at a large company, where I supervised a team of nine who handled all of our web design and front-end development. Now, I&#8217;m out on my own as the founder of a small web studio.</p>

		<h2>Things you might like to know about&nbsp;me</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>I&#8217;ve been married twelve years and have two wonderful kids. Family is very important, which is good because we have quite a bit of it around here. I&#8217;d like to stay near my family, but still work with some top-notch people in the industry.</li>
			<li>I like to work in my garden and build things with my hands. My last major project was walnut counter tops for my kitchen. Next up, a tree house for the kids.</li>
			<li>I have a background in theatrical design and production&#8212;lights, sets, audio. This is where I think I really learned the values of craft, creative problem solving, and melding the technical with the artistic.</li>
			<li>Two years ago, I began volunteering time as a soccer coach at the local high school. The challenge has been beyond what I anticipated, but getting to know the kids has been great. I like learning how to be a more effective coach, and I like an excuse to stay fit.</li>
			<li>Teaching other people is a passion. I led weekly &#8220;intermediate to advanced HTML, CSS and JavaScript&#8221; classes with my previous team, and I love seeing that information passed on and then used to make awesome things. I also started a &#8220;beginners&#8221; class that other people at my company could participate in. I developed a curriculum for this sort of training a few years ago, which, unfortunately, has not been used much since going independent.</li>
			<li>Currently, I&#8217;m doing web projects as <a href="http://guerillalabs.co">Guerilla Labs</a>. You should take a look at <a href="https://github.com/guerillalabs">our github page</a> to get a sense of some things we&#8217;re working on. You&#8217;ll find several older jQuery plugins, but I want to specifically point out <a href="https://github.com/guerillalabs/Sasspool">Sasspool</a>&#8212;a Sass-based framework. There is a lot in Sasspool borrowed from other places and a lot I wrote specifically to fit our needs. It is shaping up to be a really helpful tool. Also, the <a href="http://guerillalabs.co">Guerilla Labs</a> site is built in Jekyll.</li>
			<li>Sass has been a big interest. I love how it can make writing CSS more efficient and consistent across a project. There are several mixins that I&#8217;m particularly proud of&#8212;which can all be seen within the Sasspool project.</li>
			<li>Over the years, I've spent a lot of time in WordPress and ExpressionEngine, recently completed my first project in Statamic, have built several personal sites with Jekyll, and have been a part of teams that have built sites and content management systems in Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Node, and Drupal. I also maintain a couple of Shopify sites.</li>
			<li>I love that our industry is built on sharing ideas and techniques. While I worry that the barrier to entry is much higher than it was when I started on the web, I&#8217;m so glad that new people can enter, get guidance from seasoned veterans, and start creating amazing things. I use <a href="http://codepen.io/jacobfentress">CodePen</a> as a laboratory to try out and share new code.</li>
			<li>My work for the last couple of years has included working on the <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a> site, co-founding and building <a href="https://spoken.co">Spoken</a> with Cameron Moll, Adam Spooner and Myles Grant, building a unique Shopify/WordPress hybrid at <a href="http://ugmonk.com/">Ugmonk</a> for Jeff Sheldon, working with Matthew Smith on an <a href="http://mailchimp.com/agencies/">agencies focus</a> for MailChimp, building the new (now defunct) site for Jesse and Drew at <a href="http://31three.com">31Three</a>, building several sites with the folks at <a href="http://crushlovely.com">Crush &amp; Lovely</a>, developing responsive email templates for the new <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/">NPR One app</a> and everything from updates for a local peach-focused food truck to a suite of sites for a therapist out of Texas. I've worked with companies and organizations both large and quite small&#8212;building full sites and taking care of tiny tweaks.</li>
			<li>There are other, newer projects that I cannot post to my site, yet, and older projects that I would rather talk through in person&#8212;some are offline, some changed drastically from what I handed off and some I am ashamed of. They include things like building an HTML based ebook platform, implementing multiple CMS installations and training our writers to use Markdown as their editing environment&#8212;in early 2006.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Some things I&#8217;m spending more time on right&nbsp;now</h2>

		<ul class="condensed">
			<li><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/meaningful-css-style-like-you-mean-it">Meaningful CSS</a></li>
			<li>site performance</li>
			<li>vanilla javascript</li>
			<li>SVGs</li>
			<li>ARIA Roles</li>
			<li>Affinity Photo & Designer</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Let&#8217;s work together</h2>

		<p>I think we could do some great work together. Send me a message through <a href="mailto:jfentress@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jfentress">Twitter</a>, and we&#8217;ll chat.</p>

		<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
